My code solutions for the 2021 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challenge.

For each folder:
 - Denotes the day of the challenge
 - `__main__.py`: The code solution
 - `input.txt`: The input code to be tested
 - `sample.txt`: The sample code to compare with

## Requirements

```
Then, run the python program with this command
