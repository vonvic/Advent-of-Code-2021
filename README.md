# Advent-of-Code-2021
My code solutions for the 2021 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challenge.

For each folder:
 - Denotes the day of the challenge
 - `problem.py`: The code solution
 - `input.txt`: The input code to be tested
 - `sample.txt`: The sample code to compare with
 - ...and other input files.

## Requirements
```
Python 3.10.0
```
